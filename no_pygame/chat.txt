I'm feeling stuck on the login terminal. Try running it to figure out what is wrong.

my OTHER terminal, which you, dad, are the only one who has seen until 7/1/19, is acting up. the error is:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/Documents/programming/terminal.py", line 57, in <module>
    command()
  File "/home/pi/Documents/programming/terminal.py", line 8, in command
    inputCommand = input(username + "@pythonterminal:~ $ ")
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'username' referenced before assignment


I declare 'username' before I call command().

I guess that you cannot use a global variable in a function(?)
 I tried this:
 
print("This program is copyright of Mcalpin Programming, Inc.")
print("The default password is 'pythonterminal'")
print("Type 'help' for a list of commands.")
print("")

def command():
    password = "pythonterminal"
    username = "default"
    inputCommand = input(username + "@pythonterminal:~ $ ")
    if inputCommand == "exit":
        quit()

    elif inputCommand == "print-data":
        print(" Your name is " + username + ".")

    elif inputCommand == "help":
        print(" The commands you can use are:")
        print("     exit - quit the terminal")
        print("     help - opens the help page")
        print("     print-data - View your data")
        print("     change-user - Change the username")
        print("     change-password - Change the password")

    elif inputCommand == "":
        command()

    elif inputCommand == "change-user":
        print("This command requres superuser privileges.")
        inputPassword = input("What is your password? ")
        if inputPassword == password:
            check = True
        else:
            check = False
        if check == True:
            username = input("What would you like the username to be? ")
        else:
            print("Sorry, the password is incorrect.")

    elif inputCommand == "change-password":
        print("This command requres superuser privileges.")
        inputPassword = input("What is your password? ")
        if inputPassword == password:
            check = True
        else:
            check = False
        if check == True:
            password = input("What would you like the password to be? ")
        else:
            print("Sorry, the password is incorrect.")

    else:
        print(" Bash: " + inputCommand + ": command not found.")
while True:
    command()

But it re-defines "username" and "password" every time the function is called.
